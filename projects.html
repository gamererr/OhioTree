                <li><a href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/" target="_blank">Slime full body trackers for VR</a>: This projet I have been using to learn electrical engineering. It's always been an interest of mine but I never really had the chance to try a project in that vein until this one, and as an added bonus I get a cool upgrade to my VR gaming setup.</li>
                <li><b>Lawn mower engine go-kart</b>: This one I am doing with a few friends, we are gonna make 2 different go-karts and try to race them. The learning goal of this project is to understand how mechanical contraptions like cars work. Also I get to make a vehicle, which is pretty cool.</li>
                <li><b>Horror short films</b>: This project was proposed to me by a friend I met in my high school's theater club. I have always wanted to do screen acting even before I joined the drama club, so I am really thrilled for this project this summer.</li>
                <li><b>A website</b>: It might sound funny, but you're currently looking at another one of my projects to work on over the next year. In the fall I plan on taking a web design class to learn how to make this even better. This website is located in a <a href="https://github.com/rhozetta/rhozetta.github.io" target="_blank">Github repository</a>if you'd like to take a look at the source.</li>
